== Description

This repository contains an ansible module for modifying yaml files.

I didn't see a good method of editing yaml files and config managing them through ansible.  This is my attempt.

== Directory Structure

----
yedit
├── roles                Contains the ansible role for lib_yaml_editor
├── test                 python unit tests for yedit
----

== Examples:

Sometimes it is necesarry to config manage .yml files.
